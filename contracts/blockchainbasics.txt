The concept of blockchains aren't that hard to grasp. The underlying tech may be a bit more trivial.

Transactions
A blockchain is just a public database. You alter the blockchain by using transactions. Transactions are cryptographically signed.

Blocks
All transactionss will be bundled up into something called a block.
Blocks are added to the blockchain every 17 seconds in Ethereum.

Mining
When users 'mine' it is something part of the 'order sselection mechanism.' Blockss are reverted from time to time.
